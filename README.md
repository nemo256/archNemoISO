## Setup ‚öôÔ∏è

### Download the project:
```shell
git clone https://github.com/nemo256/archNemoISO
cd archNemoISO
```

### Create a <airootfs/root/.env> file:
```shell
USERNAME=             # your username (eg: foo)
PASSWORD=             # your password (eg: bar)
HOSTNAME=             # your hostname (eg: thinkpad)
SHELL=                # preferred shell (eg: /bin/zsh)
TOKEN=                # this is the github token (you can leave it empty)
DISK=                 # disk you want to install archNemo on (eg: /dev/sda)
MOUNT_OPTIONS=        # disk mount options (eg: "noatime,compress=zstd,ssd,commit=120")
FS=                   # filesystem type (can be ext4, btrfs...)
TIMEZONE=             # timezone like this <Continent/city> (eg: Europe/paris, America/chicago)
KEYMAP=               # keymap of the keyboard (eg: us, fr, es...)
```

### Personalize <build.sh> file:
- This is my personal arch build profile, so you can start by customizing the build.sh file, update your own personal git repos (dotfiles and such).
- You can also add any personal directories and custom files to add them directly to your custom build, path is airootfs/root/<here>.

### Finally, just make build.sh executable and run it to create your custom arch build:
```shell
chmod +x build.sh
./build.sh
```

### Now, your custom ISO is located in out/, and create a bootable flash drive: (eg: usb is /dev/sdb)
```shell
mount /dev/sdb /mnt
bsdtar -x -C /mnt -f out/archnemo-<version>.iso
```
